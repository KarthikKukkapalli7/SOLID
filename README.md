# SOLID
We have different types of principle when desining a software to achieve some advantages
- Avoid dupicate code
- easy to maintain
- easy to understand
- flexible code
- reduce complexity
To acheive this we follow some design principles that is know as SOLID principles
# S - Single responsibility principle
each class must do one task insted of mutiple tasks , because if even small change has happened in the code that leads complete of code which hard to maintain ,less flexible and even complexity of code increases due to multiple tasks included in one class.
